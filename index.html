      </section>
      <p>Welcome to my Bio page. I am a Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences with focus on Pharmaceutics and Pharmacokinetics. <p>I obtained his BPharm, MSc and MBA degrees from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife in 1989, 1995 and 1999 respectively. I obtained my PhD degree from the University of Ibadan in 2001 and my Masters’ degree in Health Informatics at the University of Illinois, Chicago in May, 2020.</p>  
        I have worked with the Sullivan University College of Pharmacy, Louisville, Kentucky (2018-2019), the Roosevelt University College of Pharmacy (2011-2018), University of the West Indies, Trinidad & Tobago (2010-2011), University of Technology, Jamaica (2002-2009) and the Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria (1992 -2002).  Until recently, my clinical affiliation was with the IV Infusion Department of MACRx Long-Term Care Pharmacy, Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA.
        <p>My research interests include: 1. dosage form design, bioavailability/bioequivalence & pharmacokinetic studies; 2. application of biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics principles in rational therapy of pediatric & geriatric patient populations through simulations and kinetic modeling; and 3. application of smart biomaterials and pharmacokinetics principles in chronopharmaceutics of time-cyclic and physiologic-cyclic conditions/disorders; and more recently, application of Information Technology, specifically Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, to Pharmaceutical Research & Development. Let’s begin the exciting journey of understanding the behind the scene of making pharmaceuticals</p>
